# 27C256_to_PROM_Adapter

The purpose of this repo is to replace the old obselete PROMs. It is recommended that you use the Atmel AT27C256-45PU. It is a very fast OTP EPROM that can be purchased from reputable sellers such as mouser.com. All board designs are done in Kicad.

These are untested as of right now, but hardware has been ordered to verify functionality. There are two jumpers, for 82S130/82S131, jump pins 1 and 2 for both jumper sets. For 82S126/82S129, jump pins 2 and 3 for both jumper sets.

*It has been tested and working as a replacement for 82S129 PROMs, as I need them I will continue to use them to verify*
